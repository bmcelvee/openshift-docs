Imagestreams, being {product-title} native resources, work out of the box with all the rest of native resources available in {product-title}, such as builds or deployments. It is also possible to make them work with native Kubernetes
resources, such as jobs, replication controllers, replica sets or Kubernetes deployments.

The cluster administrator configures exactly what resources can be used.
