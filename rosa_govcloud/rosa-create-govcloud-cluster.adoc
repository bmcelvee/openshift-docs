Federal and government agencies can be granted access to the ROSA environment without further verification. However, commercial organizations and FISMA R&D Universities will need to provide documentation to show that they are supporting a government contract or in the process of bidding on a government contract such as a RFP, RFI, pre-bid stage. The customers who are in the government support verification process can review a subset of the FedRAMP ATO documentation, but cannot gain access to the ROSA environment until verification is complete. 

To access {product-title} ROSA in AWS GovCloud, you must meet the following requirements: 

* ROSA FedRAMP can only be deployed into an existing VPC. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/getting-started-private-link.html#getting-started-private-link-step-2[Create Amazon VPC architecture for the AWS PrivateLink] use case for instructions on setting up a VPC.
* ROSA in AWS GovCloud only supports the use of the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/what-is-aws-sts-and-how-does-red-hat-openshift-service-on-aws-rosa-use-sts[AWS STS] credentials method.
* ROSA in AWS GovCloud only uses FIPS validated modules in process cryptographic libraries.
* ROSA in AWS GovCloud requires a separate Red Hat account for use with FedRAMP, even if you already have an existing Red Hat account for ROSA clusters in commercial regions.
** Each person who needs to be able to create, modify, or delete clusters must have their own Red Hat FedRAMP account.
** Access to an existing cluster, to use that cluster, does not require a Red Hat FedRAMP account.
* The relationship is:  
** One person per VPN account.
** One VPN account is tied to one device.
*** This means you cannot use your VPN credentials on a different device even if you have your hardware token.
** You can use your Red Hat FedRAMP account to deploy to multiple AWS GovCloud accounts.
* Once the access steps have been completed the rest of the documentation applies, although only the ROSA CLI is available for now.
