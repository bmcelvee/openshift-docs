= Manually configuring service account pull secrets for the integrated image registry

When a service account is created, it is automatically provisioned with pull secrets for the integrated image registry. The provisioning of pull secrets happens quickly, but is not immediate.

[WARNING]
====
If a pod is created before the service account is provisioned with the pull secret, it cannot pull images from the image registry even after the service account pull secret is  provisioned.
====

If you need to create workloads or pods that pull images from the integrated image registry immediately, you can manually configure service account pull secrets for the integrated image registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a service account.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a `./config.json` file to place the pull secret for your service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc registry login -n <NAMESPACE> -z <SERVICEACCOUNT> --to=./config.json
----
+
. Create a pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic <PULL_SECRET_NAME> \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=./config.json \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----
+
. Link the pull secret to your service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc secrets link <SERVICEACCOUNT> <PULL_SECRET_NAME> --for=pull
----
